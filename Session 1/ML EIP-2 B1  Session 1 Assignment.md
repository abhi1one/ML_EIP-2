### Primary Task 

For this Session's assignment, primary task is to write 50-100 words articles for 7 topics.

#### 1. Convolution

In mathematical terms, Convolution means deriving a function C from given function A and B. Meaning of this terms involves end result C as well as execution of computation on functions A and B.

In Machine Learning and Neural Networks terms, Convolution is a process of computation applied to input data of one layer and passing output to next layer.

#### 2. Filters / Kernels

In process of Convolution function A which is usually raw data or input of processed data from previous layer is processed with function B also referred as Filters or Kernels to derive output for results or Next layer's input in a network. 

Ideal Filter or Kernel size is 3x3 due to compute friendly nature, meaning GPUs primarily being utilized for purpose of such computation are more optimal in terms of taking less time for 3x3 kernels compared to other kernel options,  and may be consuming less energy (a hunch that may need to be looked on web).
